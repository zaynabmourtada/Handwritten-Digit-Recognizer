# Handwritten Digits Recognition using Neural Networks

## Overview

This project was completed for my CIS 481 course and is based on starter code provided by the instructor. I extended the codebase to implement full training, evaluation, visualizations, learning curves, and trial set analysis for the following models:

- Perceptron
- Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- Two-Layer DNN

The work was conducted using Google Colab, where I integrated model selection via cross-validation, plotted proxy and misclassification errors, visualized learned weights, and interpreted performance over multiple dataset sizes.

## What I Implemented

- 3-Fold Cross-Validation for hyperparameter tuning
- Learning curve visualization (proxy and misclassification error)
- Weight parameter interpretation (first-layer weights as 32×32 images)
- Model evaluation on an unseen trial dataset
- Training and performance summary with clear graphs for each model

## How to Run

1. Open the Colab notebook: `learn_nnet.ipynb`
2. Go to the **Runtime** menu and select **"Run all"**.
3. All graphs, outputs, and visualizations will be generated automatically.

## Files Included

- `learn_nnet.ipynb` – Full working notebook with all models and plots
- `CIS 481 Project 2 Report.pdf` - Final report with discussion, graphs, and weight visualizations
- `README.txt` – this file
